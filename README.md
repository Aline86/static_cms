# CMS for dynamic creation of static websites made with following technologies : React + TypeScript + Vite

CMS creation is yet not finished.
I still have to finish following tasks :

- responsive dropdowns for social medias and links
- cleaning the code and renaming some of the files.
- puting global and security variables in a .env file
- available features for the moment only cover backoffice elements.
- I still have to do the front office eventhough it is going to pick up the allready available components in the backoffice FO.
- managing videos on the website
- securing the site, for the moment there is no security.
- I want to protect backoffice authomatized routes with secured access (very important)
- full screen responsiveness has still not been fully implemented

## What the CMS can actually do for the moment

You can create pages and blocs with simultaneous visualization of user content.
backoffice is automatized. This means that you nearly don't have anything to do to implement new backoffice routes.

Some improvements were made since the videos were down.
